        <h2>About Let Me Cook</h2>
        <p>
            Let Me Cook is an innovative recipe generation application that leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to create 
            personalized recipes based on available ingredients. This project was developed to solve the common problem of 
            deciding what to cook with ingredients already in your kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application features a user-friendly interface where users can input their available ingredients and receive 
            detailed recipes complete with descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions. What sets this project 
            apart is its ability to generate recipes in multiple languages and consider user preferences and dietary restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a technical perspective, the project utilizes Flask for the backend, integrates with Google's Generative AI API, 
            and implements real-time recipe generation with dynamic loading states and engaging user feedback. The application 
            also features a responsive design, error handling, and session management for a seamless user experience.
